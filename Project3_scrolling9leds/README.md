# ABOUT PROJECT

*This file is part of a series of exercises that aim to assist in the learning of C/C++ Programming Languages, as well as to develop skills in the field of Artificial Intelligence using the Arduino microcontroller.*

*The code presented here is intended to make the LEDs turn on one after the other, being turned off in the opposite direction.*

*This alternation gives a scrolling aspect since at a given moment the LEDs are on (going direction) and at another time off (returning direction).*

*The illustration attached below clarifies the programmed movement better.*
