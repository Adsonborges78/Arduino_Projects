# ABOUT PROJECT

*This file is part of a series of exercises that aim to assist in the learning of C/C++ Programming Languages, as well as to develop skills in the field of Artificial Intelligence using the Arduino microcontroller.*

*The algorithm uses PWM to increase and decrease the brightness of an LED. This effect is called a __fade__.*

*The illustration attached below clarifies the programmed movement better.*
