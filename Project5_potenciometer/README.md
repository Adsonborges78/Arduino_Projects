# ABOUT PROJECT

*This file is part of a series of exercises that aim to assist in the learning of C/C++ Programming Languages, as well as to develop skills in the field of Artificial Intelligence using the Arduino microcontroller.*

*The potentiometer is used to control the frequency at which an LED flashes.*

*For this, the resistance of the potentiometer is read, and when turning the knob of this component to the right, the speed with which the LED flashes is increased, and the speed with which the LED flashes is decreased by turning the knob of the potentiometer to the left.*

*The speed at which the LED will flash depends on the value read in the fraction in the analogRead() function*

*The illustration attached below clarifies the programmed movement better.*
