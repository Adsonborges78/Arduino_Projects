# ABOUT PROJECT

*This file is part of a series of exercises that aim to assist in the learning of C/C++ Programming Languages, as well as to develop skills in the field of Artificial Intelligence using the Arduino microcontroller.*

*That said, the programming presented here will turn on the first LED and then turn it off, then it will turn on the second LED and then turn it off, doing the same procedure with all the LEDs, within an infinite loop until the microcontroller is turned off or reprogrammed.*
