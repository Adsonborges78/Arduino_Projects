*This file is part of a series of exercises that aim to assist in the learning of C/C++ Programming Languages, as well as to develop skills in the area of Artificial Intelligence using the Arduino microcontroller.*

*First, a photoresistor (LDR) is used to read the variation in light intensity.*

*This variation of the light level allows controlling the intensity of the brightness of an LED, being its brightness stronger (when the photoresistor is exposed to a greater amount of light) or weaker (when the photoresistor is exposed to a smaller amount of light).* 

*The illustration attached below further clarifies the purpose of the exercise.*
